Project: make a suitable replacement cathedral for the board game "The Pillars of the Earth". The game is an excellent game of strategic worker placement, now out of print. The model could be used 
to enhance the visuals of the game by replacing the wooden cathedral that comes with the game.

The project relies heavily on use of http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:16218 by Skimbal (previously http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:35798 by m_bergman (http://www.captskidd.com) but STL wasn't 
valid and I wasn't able to fix it).

The Pillars of the Earth board game (https://www.mayfairgames.com/products/pillars-earth) is trademarked by Mayfair games.
